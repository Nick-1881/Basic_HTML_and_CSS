     <p>hello world</p>

    <h1>F1</h1>

    
    <div class="intro"><p>Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for <br>open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de <br>l'Automobile (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World <br>Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its <br>inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all <br>participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as <br>Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.<br><br>

    A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers,<br> the otherfor constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing<br> licence issued by theFIA. The races must run on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest<br> grade-rating issued by the FIA.</p></div>
